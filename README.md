## PyBank
Created a Python script for analysing the financial records of a company. I have been porvided a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.I have created a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then found the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll
I have been tasked with helping a small, rural town modernise its vote counting process. I have been given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I have then created a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
